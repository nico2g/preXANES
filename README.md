# preXANES
Pre-edge analysis of X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES)

This code is intended to be an all-in-one pre-edge XANES analysis code for fast data processing. It manipulates raw XANES files,  coadds, normalizes, fits a step funciton to the edge, and fits pre-edge features to Gaussians. It has been developed  in accordance to analysis first introduced in Notestein et al J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2007, 129 (5), pp 1122â€“1131. It has only been used  for Ti K-edge spectra, but is intended as a general analysis tool in the future. Two example files (individual spectra are .001, .002, etc) are inlcuded as sample raw input files. plotter.py is the main code, while XAS_functions.py contains the different manipulating funcitons. Code tweaking may be necessary for it to work with input files from raw data from other beamlines, as well as for other elements.
